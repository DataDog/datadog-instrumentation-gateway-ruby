# Datadog Instrumentation Gateway demo prototype

``datadog-instrumentation-gateway`` is a prototype for Datadog's instrumentation tooling for Ruby. Its ultimate goal is to enable installing hooks into Ruby application code, and exposing or altering operations for monitoring purposes.

This repository contains experimental code. It is intended only as a technical demonstration and prototype of the basic building blocks that will comprise the "Instrumentation Gateway".

For the final instrumentation tooling implementation, see this repository:

For out-of-the-box instrumentation, see these other repositories:
